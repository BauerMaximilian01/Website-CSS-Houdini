      <h2 id="what-is">What is CSS Houdini?</h2>
      <p>
        Houdini is a collection of APIs that gives developers direct access to the CSS Object Model.
        This allows us to write JavaScript code that is interpreted by the browser as CSS and it directly
        affects the browser's rendering engine. New CSS features, such as animations, can be implemented
        without the need to wait for new CSS releases. More or less it is an powerful extension for CSS,
        but it is not supported by many browsers yet.
      </p>
      
      <h2 id="ready-yet">Is Houdini ready yet?</h2>
      <p>
        Unfortunately not. There are some features, for instance custom properties or the paint API, 
        which are already usable and can be processed by most 
        browsers, however there is no browser yet, supporting all features Houdini has to offer. 
        Especially, Mozilla Firefox does not support any advantages Houdini offers.
        You can inform yourself about compatibility of Houdini with different most used browsers
        using this interactive graphic:

      <h2 id="animation">Animation Worklet</h2>
      <p>
        Before we have a look at the Animation Worklet in more detail, let's take a look at Worklets in general.
        Worklets are basically browser instructions that live outside the main thread and are only active when
        called specifically. They have specific tasks and are intended for certain use cases, as it can be
        concluded from the names of the Houdini Worklets (PaintWorklet, AnimationWorklet, AudioWorklet, LayoutWorklet).
        Created Worklets must be registered using JavaScript code and are then availble to be called from the main thread.
        <br>An example code to add a Animation Worklet looks like the following:
      </p>

      <div class="code-container">
        <pre>
          <code class="language-html">
            CSS.animationWorklet.addModule("workletPath");
          </code>
        </pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        If you want to lerarn more about Worklets themselves click
        <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/worklets.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now to the Animation Worklet itself: This allows you to develop very smooth animations, because
        unlike normal animations, it does not assume, for example, 60 frames per second, rather it natively
        applies the frame rate of the device.
        <br>
        In contrast to CSS Transitions, where rather simple transitions from A to B are performed, and CSS Animations,
        where rather more complex time-dependent animations are implemented, the Houdini Animation Worklet can 
        link animations with scroll and do not depend on time.
        <br>
        Each HTML document object has a timeline component (document.timeline) that starts at 0 and represents the milliseconds 
        since the document started existing. All of the document's animations work relative to this timeline.
        <br>
        You should always check for compatibility, in our case if the Animation Worklet is supported:
        <!-- This check could look like the following: -->
      </p>

      <div class="code-container">
        <pre>
          <code>
            if(!('animationWorklet' in CSS)) {
              //Animation Worklet is not supported, tell user about incompatiblility
              document.write("You require the AnimationWorklet to see the example.");
            } else {
              //Animation Worklet is supported, insert code here
            }   
          </code>
        </pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        After making sure that the Worklet is supported, we can have a look at a small example. The example is from the
        <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/10/animation-worklet#:~:text=implementation%20just%20yet.-,Hooking,-into%20the%20space" target="_blank">Google Developer Platform</a>
        and shows an animation that is not dependent on time (document.timeline), but on a (arbitary) scrollbar. It is useful to know
        that the given HTML structure contains an element with the ID "a", which is the element that is moved back and forth
        vertically (along the X-axis) depending on the ScrollTimeline.
        <br>
        There is also an element that has the &lt;main&gt;-Tag that cointains several lines with the content "scroll me" which
        is configured so that it has a scrollbar. This scrollbar is defined as a "scrollSource" and controls the movement of the cube.
        (The further you scroll down, the further on the right the cube will be.)
        <br>
        Here the sequence is represented in the form of JavaScript code:
      </p>

      <div class="code-container">
        <pre>
          <code>
            //define an animator (name = scrollAnimator)
            registerAnimator('scrollAnimator', class {
              animate(currentTime, effect) {
                effect.localTime = currentTime;
              }
            });

            new WorkletAnimation(
              'scrollAnimator', //name of the registered animator above
              new KeyframeEffect(
                document.querySelector('#a'),
                [
                  {
                    transform: 'translateX(0)'
                  },
                  {
                    transform: 'translateX(500px)'
                  }
                ],
                {
                  duration: 2000,
                  fill: 'both'
                }
              ),
              new ScrollTimeline({
                scrollSource: document.querySelector('main'),
                orientation: "vertical",
                timeRange: 2000
              })
            ).play();
          </code>
        </pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        To better be able to interpret the description and the code above, here is a short demo clip:
        <video loop muted autoplay src="https://storage.googleapis.com/webfundamentals-assets/animation-worklet/scroller_x264.mp4">Demo clip of animation that depends on scrollbar</video>
      </p>

      <p>
        This is one of many animations that can be implemented with the Animation Worklet. The ability to make animations
        dependent on scroll is very powerful and leaves room for many unique and exciting animations.
        <br>
        It should be mentioned that the ScrollTimeLine is an experimental feature and must be activated explicitly by flag
        (the compatibility can be checked
        <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-scroll-timeline" target="_blank">here</a>)
      </p>

      <p>

        <a href="https://drafts.css-houdini.org/css-animation-worklet" target="_blank">here</a>.
      </p>
      
      <h2 id="custom-props">Custom Properties</h2>
      <p>
        CSS Custom Properties are an expanded version of the normal CSS variables. Properties can now be defined by a syntax 
        and have a semantic meaning. They also have customizable fallback values in case of a wrong syntax.
      </p>
      <p>  
        CSS variables are very useful to define values like the main font colour globally. However, normal CSS variables can
        take on any value, so an invalid colour code could be specified for a colour, which is of course incorrect, and this 
        would lead to an error. It is defined by default what happens in such cases: for example, 
        the default font colour is black, and the default background is transparent.
        But with Custom Properties, you can define your own default values.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides that, Houdini allows you to define a structure for the custom properties. Here you can find a small example in
        two different variations, where a Custom Property is defined for an accent colour:  
      </p>

      <table>
        <tr><th>external JavaScript file<br>(since Chromium 78)</th><th>directly in CSS file<br>(since Chromium 85)</th></tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <pre>
              <code>
                CSS.registerProperty({
                  name: '--accentColor',
                  syntax: '&lt;color&gt;',
                  initialValue: 'green',
                  inherits: false
                });
              </code>
            </pre>
          </td>
          <td>
            <pre>
              <code>
                @property --accentColor {
                  syntax: '&lt;color&gt;';
                  initial-value: green;
                  inherits: false;
                }
              </code>
            </pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>
        The property --accentColor can be accesed as usual with <i>var(--accentColor)</i>, but the difference is that there 
        is not just a simple string behind it, but an entire data object that also specifies a syntax. In this example, the
        attributes <i>"name", "syntax", "initialValue"</i> and <i>"inherits"</i> have been used - this gives a small insight into the attributes
        that can be used. The attributes range from <i>"length", "colour"</i> and <i>"image"</i> to even <i>custom defined idents</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        With this knowledge, the fallback values can now be described. Below, you can see a short example that uses the
        --accentColor property that we just defined. Also, there is a syntactically incorrect value given in the last block and 
        therefore the fallback value is sent by the CSS rendering engine - without Houdini the lines would be ignored.
        The comments beside describe which colour is actually used.
      </p>

      <div class="code-container">
        <pre>
          <code>
            .text {
              background-color: var(--accentColor); /* green */
              ...
            }
            
            .accent-text {
              --accentColor: blue;
              background-color: var(--accentColor); /* blue */
              ...
            }
            
            .other-text {
              --accentColor: 2022; /* invalid value -> use fallback value (green) */
              background-color: var(--accentColor); /* green */
              ...
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        This technique can be used to make awesome, but simple animations, such as a smooth gradient stop transitions.
        An approach for that is to have a default (linear) gradient with Custom Properties defined for start and end color
        and to use a transition with the color stop. It is then possible to change the used colors, for example when you have
        the gradient element. This brings smooth transitions that are very satisfying.
      </p>

      <h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h2>
      <p>
        Before diving into CSS Houdini check the compatibility of your browser, since 
        Houdini is not fully supported by many browsers yet. The best browser to try Houdini out is 
        "<a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/" target="_blank">Google Chrome Canary</a>", 
        but consider to enable the "Experimental Web Platform Feature"-flag, which enables features that are in development.
        Furthermore, start with something easy, like smooth color transitions, as Houdini is quite overwhelming.
        Afterwards you can move on to animations, but be careful as the "Animation Worklet" of Houdini
        is only partially supported - even in Canary. We also recommend you to host the code files locally using for example Live Server
        (free extension in Visual Studio Code).
